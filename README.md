>JavaFX game of Halma, a game involving 2 players trying to move all of their piece into the opposing corner of the board before the other player.

My first game that I created in JavaFX. This project really gave me a good feel for using classes and inheritance in java. Calling methods for pieces and game movements made me a much more confident programmer. 

## Rules
The aim of the game is to be the first to player to move all pieces across the board and into opposing corner. Players take turns to move a single piece of their own colour. The piece may either be simply moved into an adjacent square OR it may make one or more hops over other pieces.  Where a hopping move is made, each hop must be over an adjacent piece and into the vacant square directly beyond it.  A hop may be over any coloured piece including the player's own and can proceed in any one of the eight directions.  After each hop, the player may either finish or, if possible and desired, continue by hopping over another piece.
